          When we believe in only linear time and therefore sequential cause and

          trauma and sickness. It can lead to belief systems in which all life
          loses. That is the co-enslavement model and it is in many places on
          earth; creating stress, chaos, and destruction.
        </p>
        <p class="text-xl text-white font-cormorantInfantReg px-52 py-4">
          The co-enslaving belief system creates an infected soul frequency
          called trauma. In relationships with people and resources, it creates
          trauma bondage. It is fake, harmful, misleading (snake oil)
          connection. It is made of separation and scarcity known as “dualism"
          in philosophical and spiritual terms. The beliefs that create trauma
          are: “We are separate, There is not enough / I am not enough." We feel
          them as emotions like shame, guilt, fear, anxiety, self-loathing,
          judgement, self pity, unworthiness, anger, rage, etc.. When combined,
          they are the ingredients of self harm, addiction, unfair sharing of
          resources, power over/under dynamics, Entitlement/obligation
          relationship transactions, zero sum economics, political tyranny, and
          ALL war.
        </p>
        <p class="text-xl text-white font-cormorantInfantReg px-52 py-4">
          To believe in separation and scarcity is to lose soul. It is called
          “soul loss." There is a soul parasite feasting on our species. It eats
          lost soul.
        </p>
        <p class="text-xl text-white font-cormorantInfantReg px-52 py-4">
          The beliefs we hold affect all 3 of our time wheels. We get infected
          by and infect others. The parasite spreads. To heal from this
          infection of consciousness, one must change beliefs, practices, and
          habits of relationship with Self (inner wheel), the world (outer
          wheel), and the dream miracle dimension (other wheel).

          May we soothe with sooth and feel the truth. We are a part of nature,
          not apart from it. Our beliefs of disconnection make us susceptible to
          infection. Modern life takes its toll, on the frequency of our soul.
          In fact, there is a covert bug amongst us, finding us rather
          scrumptious; feeding on our life forces, like a meal of several
          courses. It is a pathogen called a McKraken, with a nasty attacken and
          kickbacken. It promises the world, but in its wake, only waste and
          resentment unfurl. It's slippery tongue used to enslave, when
          proximate, Oh! Never engage! Stay calm, centered and grounded,
          remember, all of its lies are unfounded.

          nervous system is made of attachment and aversion, therein lies the
          seeds of eventual perversion.

          Dysfunction casts a spell, here's how we can tell, believing that

          engage your inner bell, your truthcord is the instrument of pure
          connection. With it, feel the sound, be sure to ground, and dispel
          that dark infection.

          There are deep webs in the silent invisible, two distinct circuits
          quite discrete and divisible. One made of deceit, like being stuck in
          concrete. One of the sacred wild, free like a child. The web of deceit
          corrodes, the web of the sacred nourishes. When we engage in the
          latter, our body and soul flourishes. That which corrodes, also
          enslaves. That which nourishes, also connects. The 2nd gives us life.
          The 1st...just a hex. Staying stuck makes persistent feelings of suck,
          where the McKraken icky-sicky gets so high piled, the web of deceit,
          our souls does eat, thus choose the circuit wild.

            Neither selfish nor selfless be. Living life with internal harmony.
            Being centered in the self, alleviates self-centeredness and lack of
            self-center. In short, Self-full is so very helpful. Without
            selfullness, the McKraken finds us an easy host. A strong coherent
            core connection is what protects us most. Without core protection,
            the McKraken will encroach, believing it's empty promises, your
            soul, it does poach.

          <p class="text-center text-white m-11 font-playwrite text-xl">
            When our souls are in its clutches, we are inclined toward many
            crutches. They can take lots of forms, and over time become our
            norms, but in the end, my dear friend, we are simply stricken with
            addiction.
          </p>
          <p class="text-center text-white m-11 font-playwrite text-xl">
            An uninterrupted core connection to source, liberates and
            undomesticates our precious life force. With this, trauma bondage no
            longer shackles, and we find less need for our prickly hackles. With
            others to myself, I shan't compare, for all are worthy and unique
            like a pear. Cultivating perception that's crystal clear, brings
            true love both far and near.

          <p class="text-center text-white m-11 font-playwrite text-xl">
            Relationships that are based in solely transaction, never lead to
            actual satisfaction. When we mutually cooperate, we feel the love
            that's truly great. A right-relationship couple makes feelings
            rather supple. When it becomes McKraken, those positive feelings
            slacken. Right-relationship Provider/protector: Creator/nurturer
            McKraken Dominator/controller: Victim/enabler

          <p class="text-center text-white m-11 font-playwrite text-xl">
            When the influence of the McKraken is global, the results are dark
            and ignoble. Zero sum ain't no fun, in fact it's rather dumb. It
            erodes and wastes what nature gives, until eventually, nothing
            lives. Connection to source generates a current. With that current,
            we can make bonds of love. Those kinds of bonds bring the peace of a
            dove. So engage with source and you will see, the truth is WE are
            the current-cy.
          </p>
          <p class="text-center text-white py-48 font-playwrite text-xl">
            Externalized value is totally fake, don't be fooled by the
            ridiculous take. Zero sum is only lies, and as we learned, those
            hypnotize. So take care not to be seduced into its yucky yolk, even
            though this prayer is silly, this is seriously, no f'ing joke.
