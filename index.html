          When we believe in only linear time and therefore sequential cause and
          effect, we limit our connection to nature, enchantment, well-being,
          and the magic of life. In fact, that linear time story

          trauma and sickness. It can lead to belief systems in which all life
          loses. That is the co-enslavement model and it is in many places on
          earth; creating stress, chaos, and destruction.
        </p>
        <p class="px-16 py-4 font-cormorantInfantReg text-xl lg:px-64">
          The co-enslaving belief system creates an infected soul frequency
          called trauma. In relationships with people and resources, it creates
          trauma bondage. It is fake, harmful, misleading (snake oil)
          connection. It is made of separation and scarcity known as “dualism"
          in philosophical and spiritual terms. The beliefs that create trauma
          are: “We are separate, There is not enough / I am not enough." We feel
          them as emotions like shame, guilt, fear, anxiety, self-loathing,
          judgement, self pity, unworthiness, anger, rage, etc.. When combined,
          they are the ingredients of self harm, addiction, unfair sharing of
          resources, power over/under dynamics, entitlement/obligation based
          relationships of transaction, zero sum economics, political tyranny,
          and ALL war.
        </p>
        <p class="px-16 py-4 font-cormorantInfantReg text-xl lg:px-64">
          To believe in separation and scarcity is to lose soul. It is called
          “soul loss." There is a soul parasite feasting on our species. It eats
          lost soul.
        </p>
        <p class="px-16 py-4 font-cormorantInfantReg text-xl lg:px-64">
          The beliefs we hold affect all 3 of our time wheels. We get infected
          by and infect others. The parasite spreads. To heal from this
          infection of consciousness, one must retool beliefs, practices, and
          habits of relationship with Self (inner wheel), the world (outer
          wheel), and the dream miracle dimension (other wheel).

          This site is dedicated to bringing awareness to the soul parasite,

              May we soothe with sooth and feel the truth. We are a part of

              wake, only waste and resentment unfurl. It's slippery tongue used
              to enslave, when proximate, Oh! Never engage! Stay calm, centered

            There are deep webs in the silent invisible, two distinct circuits
            quite discrete and divisible. One made of deceit, like being stuck
            in concrete. One of the sacred wild, free like a child. The web of
            deceit corrodes, the web of the sacred nourishes. When we engage in
            the latter, our body and soul flourishes. That which corrodes, also
            enslaves. That which nourishes, also connects. The 2nd gives us
            life. The 1st...just a hex. Staying stuck makes persistent feelings
            of suck, where the McKraken icky-sicky gets so high piled, the web
            of deceit, our souls does eat, thus choose the circuit wild.

            May the veil be lifted, the layers of false sifted; Feeling the
            truth with inner eyes, living life without disguise. Our authority
            comes from within, there is no need to enforce. When we follow our
            inner guidance, all flows in its natural due course. As it comes to
            lies, no big surprise, neither a teller nor believer be. Without
            lies, you will surmise, a life wholey set free.

              Neither selfish nor selfless be. Living life with internal
              harmony. Being centered in the self, alleviates self-centeredness
              and lack of self-center. In short, Self-full is so very helpful.
              Without selfullness, the McKraken finds us an easy host. A strong
              coherent core connection is what protects us most. Without core
              protection, the McKraken will encroach, believing it's empty
              promises, your soul, it does poach.

            <p class="m-11 text-center font-playwrite text-xl text-white">
              When our souls are in its clutches, we are inclined toward many
              crutches. They can take lots of forms, and over time become our
              norms, but in the end, my dear friend, we are simply stricken with
              addiction.

            <p class="m-11 text-center font-playwrite text-xl text-white">
              An uninterrupted core connection to source, liberates and
              undomesticates our precious life force. With this, trauma bondage
              no longer shackles, and we find less need for our prickly hackles.
              With others to myself, I shan't compare, for all are worthy and
              unique like a pear. Cultivating perception that's crystal clear,
              brings true love both far and near.

              Relationships that are based in solely transaction, never lead to
              actual satisfaction. When we mutually cooperate, we feel the love
              that's truly great. A right-relationship couple makes feelings
              rather supple. When it becomes McKraken, those positive feelings
              slacken.

              When the influence of the McKraken is global, the results are dark
              and ignoble. Zero sum ain't no fun, in fact it's rather dumb. It
              erodes and wastes what nature gives, until eventually, nothing
              lives. Connection to source generates a current. With that
              current, we can make bonds of love. Those kinds of bonds bring the
              peace of a dove. So engage with source and you will see, the truth
              is WE are the current-cy.

              Externalized value is totally fake, don't be fooled by the
              ridiculous take. Zero sum is only lies, and as we learned, those
              hypnotize. So take care not to be seduced into its yucky yolk,
              even though this prayer is silly, this is seriously, no f'ing
              joke.

              To ensnare, to be fair, is always something we share. May we see

              This exact moment is true, the privilege it affords us is too.
